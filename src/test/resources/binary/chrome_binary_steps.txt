1) For Chrome, since chrome version 115 onwards there need to be added chrome binary path in binary folder of test/resources.
2) Since git does not allow to add file size larger than 100 MB, I have not added it there.
3) The file can be downloaded from https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable and should be extracted and added to test/resources/binary path as <chrome-mac-x64>.
4) he path for chrome binary is set in constants.Constants class as CHROME_BINARY_PATH. Please Make changes if needed.
5) https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads >> click on Stable.
